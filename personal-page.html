      <h1>Pinhole Cameras</h1>
      <p>One of my hobbies is pinhole photography. I love pinholes because they reduce
        photography to its basic elements: a hole/aperature, a reactive medium (paper or film),
        and exposure time. I am facinated by light and darkness, controlling both
        aspects to make an image is frustrating, exciting, and very rewarding.
        Here is a 4x5 camera that I made from a cigar-box, a satefy pin, and some scraps
        from around the house.</p>

      <h2>A Paper Negative Print from the Cigarbox Pinhole Camera</h2>
      <img src="imgs/paper-neg-barcelona.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right pad-left" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Pinhole Photo">
      <p class="p-dark">And here is an photo that I took with the camera, using expired lithography film.
        Although the exposure and composition are off, I liked the disorienting feel of the photo,
        with its mix of organic forms, the dark stretching branches from the trees,
        and manmade architecture, the sprawling brick walls; all of which are encased
        in a strange swirl of tangled ivory and mishapen plant forms. I also love the way the sunlight
        sprays down like rain, breaking up the image with spurts and spatters of white
        space. The image also captures how I felt the day after a long night of drinking,
        the morning after the art show where my friend Xavi turned an entire room into a camera
        and then made a dramatic contact print, blasting loud music to stir the chemicals,
        dancing frantically to shake them into motion, giving us a fantastic show and lots of free wine.
